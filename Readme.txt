Base of the project is generated by STM CubeMX configurator as C project, however current project is C++.
That means, changes made by CubeMX doesn't apply to the project automatically and need to be merged manually.
The easiest way is to rename main.cpp to main.c, then generate code by CubeMX and then rename main.c to main.cpp back.
main.cpp in Git repository is adapted main.c generated by CubeMX, so the structure of code is similar.
User code in main.cpp is enclosed between autogenerated comments used by CubeMX to keep it untouched.
When generating new/changed configuration, CubeMX can change HAL drivers which are already in Git repository 
and also will generate/modify main.c file and *.h files.
